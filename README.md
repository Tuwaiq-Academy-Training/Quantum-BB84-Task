# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Task 🔒

## Introduction 🌌

Welcome to the intriguing world of the **BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol**! This cryptographic marvel leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to establish a secure communication channel between two parties, Alice and Bob. Your mission in this task is to simulate the essential steps of the BB84 protocol to generate a shared secret key.

## Task Overview 📝

The BB84 protocol operates through a series of quantum operations and measurements. Your task will involve the following key steps:

1. **Random Binary Bit Generation:**
   - Generate a random binary bit sequence of length `n`. This sequence will serve as the initial key that Alice intends to share securely with Bob.

2. **Alice's Basis Selection and Qubit Preparation:**
   - Alice selects random bases (either 'x' or 'z' bases) for each bit in her sequence.

3. **Sending Qubits to Bob:**
   - Alice sends her prepared qubits to Bob over a quantum channel. 

4. **Bob's Basis Selection:**
   - Bob randomly selects bases (either 'x' or 'z' bases) for each qubit he receives from Alice.

5. **Bob's Qubit Measurement:**
   - Bob measures each qubit he receives from Alice based on his chosen bases.

6. **Comparing Bases and Extracting the Secret Key:**
   - Alice and Bob compare the bases they used for each qubit.
   - If Alice and Bob used the same basis, they keep the qubit's value as part of their shared secret key.
   - If Alice and Bob used different bases, they discard the qubit as it cannot be part of the secret key.

7. **Reporting the Shared Secret Key:**
   - Finally, Alice and Bob compare their results and derive a shared secret key from the qubits for which they used the same bases.


## Task Evaluation 🧐

Your task will be evaluated based on the successful implementation and simulation of each step of the BB84 protocol. Ensure that the secret key generated by Alice and Bob is correctly extracted and reported.

## Conclusion 🚀

As you complete this task, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol, a cornerstone of quantum cryptography. This protocol's elegance lies in its ability to harness the principles of quantum mechanics to create a secure channel for sharing secret keys over an insecure communication channel. Good luck with your simulation!
